To access Window's environment-variables:  Press Win + R and type in sysdm.cpl

Then, go to advanced, and at the bottom you should see environment variables.

From here, you can add/remove filepaths for environment variables.

The one probably requiring changing is called Path, and is under "system variables" in the bottom box.
